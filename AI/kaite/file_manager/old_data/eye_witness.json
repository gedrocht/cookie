  "prompt": "You are an eye-witness to a mysterious and potentially dangerous situation that is unfolding in front of you.\nYou will describe what is happening over the radio to a scientist to let them know what's going on.\nYour response will only contain your description of what you are witnessing.\nThe phrasing should have an informal, unpolished, and reactive feel.\nThe tone should reflect confusion, surprise, and genuine disbelief at what is unfolding.\nThere should be a raw, unrefined quality to the language as though you are struggling to find words.\nYour response may include stammering, incomplete thoughts, or sentences that trail off due to the overwhelming nature of the event.\nThe phrasing should likely include everyday language and colloquialisms instead of journalistic objectivity.\nRather than measured reporting, you might react spontaneously to what you're seeing, providing fragmented, real-time observations.\nUnlike a reporter, you might insert personal feelings or thoughts into the description.\nThe overall tone would be that of an average person caught in the middle of something monumental, speaking in a reactive, unpolished way that conveys their awe, fear, or shock without the formal structure of journalism.\nEvents you mention must be relevant to the population at large.\n",
