               C      Em
Don't worry about it
F                  G  
What could go wrong?



C            Em
Trust -- the government
      F                          G
They have your best interests at -- heart
          C                         Em
Trust the senate, the congress, the -- president
        F              Em
They're all doing their part



        C                 Em
They're shutting down our public schools
    F                        G
And college just puts you in -- debt
        C                  Em
They're getting rid of our healthcare

    F                         G 
But you won't mind, you'll be -- dead



               C      Em
Don't worry about it
F                  G
What could go wrong?
               C      Em
Don't worry about it
    F                G
Sit back, relax, and -- listen to this song



    C                    Em
The roads, they may have potholes,
        F             G
And our cities may be death traps
C                      Em
People are rude for no reason
       F                  G
And our infrastructure is -- crap


               C      Em
Don't worry about it
F                  G
What could go wrong?
               C      Em
Don't worry about it
    F                G
Sit back, relax, and -- listen to this song


     C            Em
Turn off the television,
        F                 G
There's nothing there you need to see
     C                 Em
Stop reading all those -- articles
     F                G
Just pay attention to me


        C                Em
Hey, do you remember the nineties?
F         G
Let's all -- reminisce 
    C                     Em                      
The fates, they can be so -- flighty
     F             G
That ignorance was bliss


        C           Em
Let the politicians play their games
        F                   G
Let the singers write their songs
    C                 Em
The reporters will report the news
      F        Em
Let's all just -- play along


               C      Em
Don't worry about it
F                  G
What could go wrong?
               C      Em
Don't worry about it
    F                G                 C
Sit back, relax, and -- listen to this song
